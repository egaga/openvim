- refactor
-- doActionFor is not properly done, it's specific to deleting; make a general applyActionTo which finds movement
--- action can give accepted movements, which are checked when user is giving movement area
-- robust test engine, e.g. if test case has multiple cursors or cursor wrapping more than one character, show it to the user properly!
-- command should be added only if it is done fully (for repeat command to make sense)

- should show macro recording on status bar?
- tutorial: show previous cursor

- add commands for
-- /pattern
-- times-actions: 
--- 3ihey will yield to heyheyhey 
--- d3fa will remove until third occurrence of a
-- yanking
--- movements can be inclusive (i) or exclusive (w)
-- pasting

-- remove highlighting: http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/k8t2l/once_my_search_is_over_how_do_i_remove_the/

- a solver: user makes a) initial text b) result text; then AI tries to solve/optimize which keycombinations get from a) to b)
- statistics for commands, e.g. for commands over one character, like "2w"
- vimhero: try to complete vim-tasks as quickly as possible
- documentation could be hosted on a site. two column panel would have the documentable item on the left and on the right there could be live demo how it works
- vimtask: column based tasklist like trello.com but with vim commands
- vim dropping paragraphs, tetrislike, action takes time, so faster with 2d
