"I'll teach you what Vim is about without hassle. If you are in a hurry, "
"press any key to fast forward."

"To practice what you've learned, try out the |practice| page. It has a "
"context sensitive reference for commands."

#: sections.js:85
msgid "Now, let me introduce you to basics of Vim."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:88
msgid "Two modes, insert and normal"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:91
msgid ""
"Vim has two basic modes. One is |insert| mode, in which you write text as "
"if in normal text editor."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:92
msgid ""
"Another is |normal| mode which provides you efficient ways to navigate and "
"manipulate text."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:93
msgid ""
"At any time, you can see which mode you are in on the status bar which is "
"located at the top of the editor."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:94
msgid "To change between modes, use |Esc| for normal mode and |i| for insert mode"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:95
msgid "Let's try it out! First, change to insert mode."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:103
msgid ""
"Good, now you're in insert mode. Write something and change back to normal "
"mode."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:108
msgid "Good. Let's move on to another section."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:116
msgid "Basic movement: h, j, k, and l"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:119
msgid ""
"In contrast to regular text editor, you use keys |h|, |j|, |k|, and |l| "
"instead of arrow keys to move the cursor."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:120
msgid "Let's see how it works in practice!"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:126
msgid "Let's move on."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:131
msgid "Word movement: w, e, b"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:134
msgid ""
"To navigate the text in terms of words, you can use keys |w|, |b|, and |e| "
"(also W, B, E in real Vim)."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:135
msgid ""
"|w| moves to the start of next word; |e| moves to the end of the word; and "
"|b| moves to beginning of the word."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:141
msgid "Word! Let's move on."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:146
msgid "Number powered movement, e.g. 5w"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:149
msgid ""
"Moving within the text is not limited to individual keys; you can combine "
"movement keys with a |number|. For example, |3w| is the same as pressing w "
"three times."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:155
msgid "With numbers, ain't no numbness."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:161
msgid "Insert text repeatedly, e.g. 3iYes"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:164
msgid "You can insert text multiple times."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:165
msgid "For example, an underline of a header might consist of 30 |-|s."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:167
msgid "With |30i-| |Esc|, there's no need to press |-| 30 times."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:168
msgid "Let's try it out: insert |go| three times."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:174
msgid "See? 10iAll work is only playEsc."

#: sections.js:179
msgid "Find a character, f and F"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:182
msgid ""
"To find and move to the next (or previous) occurrence of a character, use "
"|f| and |F|, e.g. |fo| finds next o."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:183
msgid ""
"You can combine f with a number. For example, you can find 3rd occurrence "
"of 'q' with |3fq|, que?"
msgstr ""

msgid "F-f-f-ast!"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:194
msgid "Go to matching parentheses, %"
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:197
msgid ""
"In text that is structured with parentheses or brackets, |(| or |{| or |[|, "
"use |%| to jump to the matching parenthesis or bracket."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:198
msgid "Here is (a sample) text to try that."
msgstr ""

#: sections.js:206
msgid "Go to start/end of line, 0 and $"
